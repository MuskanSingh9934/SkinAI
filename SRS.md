## Software Requirements Specification (SRS) for SkinAI

## 1. Introduction
### 1.1 Purpose
The purpose of this Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document is to provide a detailed description of the functionalities, requirements, and constraints of the SkinAI application. SkinAI aims to provide users with an AI-powered platform to analyze their skin conditions and provide immediate insights and precautions based on the analysis.

### 1.2 Scope
SkinAI will be a web application built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack integrated with a machine learning (ML) service for skin condition analysis. The system will allow users to upload images of their skin, receive an analysis report, and obtain preliminary suggestions regarding their skin health.

### 1.3 Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations
- AI: Artificial Intelligence
- ML: Machine Learning
- MERN: MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js
- SRS: Software Requirements Specification
- API: Application Programming Interface
- UI: User Interface

### 1.4 References
- MERN Stack Documentation
- TensorFlow and PyTorch Documentation
- MongoDB Documentation

### 1.5 Overview
This SRS document includes detailed descriptions of the systemâ€™s functionalities, user interface, hardware and software requirements, system constraints, and other specifications.

## 2. Overall Description
### 2.1 Product Perspective
SkinAI will function as a standalone web application. It will leverage the MERN stack for the application logic and user interface and integrate with an external machine learning service for image analysis.

### 2.2 Product Functions
- **User Registration and Authentication:** Secure user registration and login functionalities.
- **Image Upload:** Allow users to upload images of their skin for analysis.
- **ML-Based Analysis:** Analyze uploaded images using a trained machine learning model.
- **Results Display:** Provide users with detailed analysis reports and preliminary suggestions.
- **History Tracking:** Maintain a record of all past uploads and analysis results for each user.

### 2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
- **General Users:** Individuals looking to analyze their skin conditions. They may have limited technical knowledge and seek an easy-to-use interface.
- **Administrators:** Individuals responsible for managing the application, ensuring system health, and monitoring user activity.

### 2.4 Operating Environment
- **Frontend:** Modern web browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- **Backend:** Node.js environment, MongoDB database
- **ML Service:** Python environment with Flask and TensorFlow/PyTorch

### 2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints
- The application must comply with relevant data privacy and security regulations.
- The ML model must be trained and validated with a suitable dataset to ensure accuracy.
- The system should be scalable to handle an increasing number of users and image uploads.

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
- Users have access to a device with a camera or means to upload images.
- The system relies on the availability of external machine learning services for image analysis.
- Internet connectivity is required for accessing the application and its features.
